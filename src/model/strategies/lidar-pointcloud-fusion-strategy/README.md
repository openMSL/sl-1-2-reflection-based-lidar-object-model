# Point Cloud Fusion Strategy

This strategy performs the fusion of the point clouds from input sensors as part of the Reflection Based Lidar Model.
It transforms the detections from the individual spherical coordinate systems of the sensors into a unified Cartesian coordinate system of the ego vehicle.

NOTE:
This strategy needs transformation-functions from ../transformation-functions!
