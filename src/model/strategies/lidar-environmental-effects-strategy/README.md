# Lidar Environmental Effects Strategy

This strategy adds environmental effects due to fog, rain, sunlight and road spray to the detections, previously calculated by the Detection Sensing Strategy.

## Fog, Rain, Snow, Sun Light

In the "Lidar-Environmental-Effects-Strategy", several weather influences are added to the simulated point cloud.
The influences are parameterizable via the sensor profiles and calibrated for certain sensors based on measurements published by Linnhoff et al.[[2](#Linnhoff2022)</sup>]
The stochastically modeled weather conditions include
- Direct Sunlight
- Fog
- Rain
- Snow

## Road Spray

The road spray simulation is based on a methodical data set recorded in real spray conditions on a test track covering multiple vehicle classes, different pavement watering levels and object speeds ranging from 50 km/h to 130 km/h.
Modeling parameters are extracted from the recorded data and utilized to calibrate a novel stochastic road spray model.
The model is focused on simulating clustering effects appearing in the lidar point cloud due to turbulence in the spray plume.
More detail can be found shortly in an upcoming publication, currently under review.
The following video shows a sneak preview of the spray simulation with a van overtaking a stationary vehicle at 100 km/h.
