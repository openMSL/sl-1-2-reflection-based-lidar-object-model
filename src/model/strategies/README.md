# Modular OSMP Framework - *strategies* Folder

The strategies folder contains individual folders for every strategy.
Inside the modular strategies the actual model code is written. So every strategy is contained in their own folder with their own includes, src and CMakeLists.

The *sequence.conf* defines, in which order the strategies are called by the framework.
The individual strategies are listed in lines in this file.
