:warning: **Current version not compliant with official ASAM OSI**: The current version of the model is build on the enhancements to the Open Simulation Interface from the publicly funded SETLevel project. It is therefore dependent on the non-standard [SL OSI](https://gitlab.setlevel.de/open/osi) and not [ASAM OSI](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface).

This is the FZD Reflection Based Lidar Model based on the FZD OSI Sensor Model Packaging Framework.
It is a highly parameterizable sensor system model including detection calculation and object tracking simulation.
The model gets lidar reflection calculated in a simulation tool beforehand e.g. with ray tracing.
The model outputs are lidar detections and detected moving objects.<br><br>

## Modeling Approach

### Modeling Framework

The outer layer of the model is the [Modular OSMP Framework](https://gitlab.com/tuda-fzd/perception-sensor-modeling/modular-osmp-framework) by FZD.
It specifies ways in which models using the [Open Simulation Interface (OSI)](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface) are to be packaged for their use in simulation environments using [FMI 2.0](https://fmi-standard.org).

The actual logic of the model is packed in so called strategies.
This is where the magic happens.
The `apply()` function of the strategy is called by the `do_calc()` function of the Framework.
There are four subsequent strategies as shown in the image below.

### Modeling of Beam Divergence by Super-Sampling with Rays

The super-sampled reflections that describe the beam-divergence of the simulated lidar sensor are calculated in the simulation tool bevorehand.
As a first step in the here described model, they are sorted per beam.
Next, the rays per beam are sorted by distance to start a peak-detection process, finding as many peaks or echoes as parameterized in the currently active profile.
During that process, a threshold is applied to the reflections, as visualized by the red dashed line in the figure below.
In this figure, the noise floor is depicted in blue.
It is not explicitly modeled, but indirectly covered by the threshold.
Finally, the echo pulse width in m, depicted in the same figure as the widths [A, B] and [C, D], and the intensity for each echo are calculated based on the correctly summarized signal strengths from the corresponding reflections.
Consequently, compared to single-ray-per-beam ray tracing, in partly occlusion scenarios, where the diverging lidar beam hits an object in front and another one behind, two detections can be derived, as it would be the case with a real lidar sensor.<br><br>

<img src="doc/img/over_sampling.png" width="800" />

The image depicts the super-sampling of a lidar sensor beam and the detection calculation within the reflection-based lidar sensor simulation from [[1](#Rosenberger2020)</sup>, p. 192]. The intervals A-B and C-D mark the resulting echoes at the edge-shaped object (left) and in the signal (right). The ⊗ visualizes the center of a beam that one would get by single-ray-per-beam ray tracing without multi-echo capability.<br><br>

After transformation of the detections from the sensor's spherical coordinates to the vehicle's Cartesian coordinates, they are available as osi3::LogicalDetections.
Subsequently, the tracking-strategy is applied on the calculated logical detections.
It uses the extreme points of the detections for every object for dimension and pose estimation.
At first, position, orientation, and dimensions are estimated as the detected object state.
The detected objects are compared to a list of previously detected and tracked objects and thereby added, updated or possibly deleted.
The track logic can be specified in the model profile.
It specifies e.g. the number of consecutive cycles an object has to be detected to create a new track or how many cycles an object is tracked without any detection.
Therefore, objects that are hidden now, but where previously detected, are still tracked estimating their movement by either using ground truth information or by predictions based on detected objects of the previous time steps.
The estimation of the object dimensions is also considered and filtered over several cycles.
If an object is no longer detected over a defined number of cycles, it is deleted from the list.
Consideration of the class uncertainties is provided by the model architecture, as well.
The output of the tracking module is a list of tracked objects.

### Modeling of Weather Influence on Lidar Point Cloud

In the "Lidar-Environmental-Effects-Strategy", several weather influences are added to the simulated point cloud.
The influences are parameterizable via the sensor profiles and calibrated for certain sensors based on measurements published by Linnhoff et al.[[2](#Linnhoff2022)</sup>]
The stochastically modeled weather conditions include
- Direct Sun Light
- Fog
- Rain
- Snow

### Modeling of Road Spray in Lidar Point Cloud

The "Lidar-Environmental-Effects-Strategy" does not only contain weather effects, but also other environmental conditions, specifically the influence of road spray on lidar.
The road spray simulation is based on a methodical data set recorded in real spray conditions on a test track covering multiple vehicle classes, different pavement watering levels and object speeds ranging from 50 km/h to 130 km/h.
Modeling parameters are extracted from the recorded data and utilized to calibrate a novel stochastic road spray model.
The model is focused on simulating clustering effects appearing in the lidar point cloud due to turbulences in the spray plume.
More detail can be found shortly in an upcoming publication, currently under review.[[3](#Linnhoff2022-2)</sup>]

## Parameterization

The profiles are parameterized in the files `profile_*.hpp.in`.
The parameters are defined in the files `profile.hpp.in`.
The profiles can be extended by the strategies with additional parameters and values in their respective folders as in e.g. `src/model/strategies/lidar-tracking-strategy/` with `profile_struct.hpp.in` with the parameters and `profile_*.hpp.in` with the values.

The profile to be loaded for simulation is set via a model parameter defined in the `modelDescription.xml` of the FMU.
The first name in `src/model/profiles/profile_list.conf` is taken as default.
If you would like to have a different one or if your simulation master does not support the configuration of model parameters, you have to adapt the *start* value of the parameter `profile` in `src/osmp/modelDescription.in.xml`.
